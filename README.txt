Assessment Task

Question 1: Using the provided dataset “exams”
For Part(a) use Python code and MS-Excel, for Part (b) use Python code

a) Compute central and dispersion measures for the attributes (math score, reading
score).

b) Describe the data attribute “race/ethnicity” using the appropriate graph type

c) For attributes (writing score), use the three-sigma interval to specify the outliers if
any.

Question 2

a) Solve the following question (manually and in Python programming) and
explain which distribution seems most appropriate for it
Suppose the owner of a bakery knows that the mean daily demand for his
wholemeal bread is 400 loaves and the standard deviation is 20. What is the
probability that the demand for its bread will be 450 loaves?

b) In a school of 320 students, 85 students are in the band, 120 students are on sports
teams, and 60 students participate in both activities. If a student is selected
randomly, what is the probability that the student will participate in both activities?
